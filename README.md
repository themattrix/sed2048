2048.sed
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/themattrix/sed2048.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/themattrix/sed2048)
[![run on repl.it](http://repl.it/badge/github/themattrix/sed2048)](https://repl.it/github/themattrix/sed2048)

This is a sed implementation of the [2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). All of the game logic is in sed. Bash is used to supply the sed script with user input and with pseudo-random numbers.

Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to control. Run with:

    $ ./src/2048.sh

Disable colorized output with:

    $ ./src/2048.sh --no-color

Gameplay difference from the original 2048 game:

- None that I'm aware of :)

Here's a [demo of me button-mashing](http://showterm.io/672c38e5dfe9dd0b58330).

> Note for OS X users: The version of sed installed by default has different options than the Linux one. Notably, it does not have the extended-regex option `-r`. A compatible version is available through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install gnu-sed --default-names` (the `--default-names` flag is used to ensure it installs as `sed` and not `gsed`). You can also build the latest version from here: http://sed.sourceforge.net/
